# High-level Programming
This repository features all the projects of Holberton School's "higher-level programming" section done by Mateo GAllo from C#18.

All these projects where done using the programming languages Python, JavaScript, and MySQL using the code editors Vi and VSCode.

## About Python

</p>
<p>Python is an interpreted programming language known for its readability, simlicity, and versatility. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.</p>
<p>Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.</p>
<p>Its versatility allows developers to use this tool in a wide arrange of areas, including web development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, automation, scripting, and more. It offers dynamic typing, allowing developers to create variables withot specifying their type. The interpreter determines the type during runtime. Python is also a cross-platform tool, meaning that the code you write can be run on various operating systems without modification.</p>

<p>JavaScript follows the steps of Python, being a versatile, high-level, dynamically-typed programming language primarily used for front-end web development. Developed by Netscape, JavaScript was introduced in 1995 to make web pages interactive and dynamic. Over The years, it has evolved and expanded its rol, becoming a key language not only for client-side scripting but also for server-side development.</p>
<p>JavaScript features helped the webpages become what they are nowadays, thanks to features such as object oriented programming, cross-browser compatibility, its popular frameworks like jQuery, React, etc; asyncronous programming, event-driven programming, and a lot more.</p>
<p>JavaScript can also be used in a runtime environment for to execute its code outside of a web browser with tools like NodeJS.</p>

### About NodeJS
<p>NodeJS allows developers to use JavaScript to write server-side applications, providing a platform for building scalable and high-performance network applications.</p>

<p>MySQL is a relational database management system that is widely used for managing and organizing structured data. It was originally developed by a swedish company called MySQL AB and realesed in 1995. MySQL is known for its performance, reliability, and ease of use, making it one of the most popular database systems in the world.</p>
